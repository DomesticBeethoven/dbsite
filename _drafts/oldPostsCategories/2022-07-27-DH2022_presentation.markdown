## __DH2022: Digital Humanities Conference 2022 Presentation “Modeling Music for Musicologists: A Linked Open Data Approach”__

In anticipation of our team presentation and article for the [Digital Libraries for Musicology (DLfM)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3543882.3543891){:target="_blank"} conference this summer, Mark presented the current state of the project's data model at the international [Digital Humanities (DH2022)](https://dh2022.adho.org/) conference (hosted in Tokyo, but fully online). Like the DLfM article, this also focused on the development and rationale for our data model, but was condensed for the Short Presentation format. As questioners wondered if the model wouldn't unsettle the traditional relationship between a work and its derivations, Mark assured the audience that this was, in fact, the point!
