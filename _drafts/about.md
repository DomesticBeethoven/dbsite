## Objectives
The objectives of ​Beethoven in the House encompass two novel and complementary studies into domestic music arrangements of the 19th Century, a digital research environment which will be co-developed alongside the studies, and the innovative application of digital musicology methods within this environment.

__i. A study of Beethoven arrangements using digital music encodings__

__ii. A study of musicological patterns in domestic arrangements__

__iii. A prototype digital environment for musicological exploration of digital material__

__iv. Innovative digital methodologies supporting musicological studies__

## Project work packages
Project objectives will be realised through nine work packages (WP). Every WP is led by a team member with particular expertise and experience in that subject area, and is collaboration between at least two of the project partners - the __Beethoven-Haus__ (BH), the __Bodleian Libraries__ (Bod), the __Oxford e-Research Centre__ (OeRC), and the __Zentrum Musik – Edition – Medien__ (ZenMEM) at the University of Paderborn. Allocation of effort from each partner to a WP is indicated in person months (PM), and is consistent with the effort totals provided in the German and UK budgets, respectively.
