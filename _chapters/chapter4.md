A key feature of the Annotator is the ability to identify and comment on the same musical material as it appears in two different pieces. 

The first step in the process is selecting and saving the relevent portions of the different versions to be compared
(see __[Chapter 3]({{ site.baseurl }}/chapters/chapter3/)__).

To bring together two parallel passages that express the same musical material:

* move the cursor to the upper right side of the window below the title bar, where it says "Annnotator Mode" and select "Annotate".
* Create a new "Musical Material" object by clicking on the plus " __+__ " sign to the right of "__Musical Materials__" in the middle of the left sidebar.
* Enter a descriptive label into the text box.
* Use the plus " __+__ " sign to add the corresponding extracts.
* Click the checkmark __âœ“__ to save.
