A key feature of the Annotator is the ability to identify and comment on the same musical material as it appears in two different pieces. 

The first step in the process is selecting and saving areas of interest in the individual versions
(see&nbsp;__[Chapter 3]({{ site.baseurl }}/chapters/chapter3/)__).

**To bring together two parallel passages that express the same musical material:**

* move the cursor to the upper right side of the window below the title bar, where it says "Annnotator Mode" and select "Annotate".
