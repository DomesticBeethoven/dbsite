The Beethoven in the House project required several customizations to the standard MEI encoding format to accommodate our arrangement comparison use cases and our Music Annotation Ontology.

<!--more-->

We needed to ensure sufficient metadata was present for use within our Annotator App, and that the appropriate encoding framework was in place so we could use our our chosen editor, __[MEI-Friend](https://mei-friend.mdw.ac.at/){:target="_blank"}__, as a musicologist-friendly method to create digitized scores.

The __[schema file](https://github.com/DomesticBeethoven/data/blob/main/schema/bith.sch){:target="_blank"}__ and __[custom ODD](https://github.com/DomesticBeethoven/data/blob/main/schema/custom-bith.odd){:target="_blank"}__ are available in the __[project repository](https://github.com/DomesticBeethoven){:target="_blank"}__ .
