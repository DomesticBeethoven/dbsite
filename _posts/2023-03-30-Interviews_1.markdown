In the weeks following the [Beethoven-Studienkolleg](https://domestic-beethoven.eu/hausmusik/2022/09/08/Studienkolleg_1.html), nine participants took part in more in-depth interviews about our [web application tool](https://tool.domestic-beethoven.eu). The interviews took about one hour each and were centered around the app’s functionality and user experience.

The interviews revealed that the tool has potential for a broad range of uses besides the original purpose of comparing arrangements, and the overall design was in general favourably rated.

At the project’s meeting in Oxford in December 2022, the team discussed ways to make the tool better and the new features that students and researchers would like to see. These discussions were used to decide what issues to prioritize for version 2 of the app.
