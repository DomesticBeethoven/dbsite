The [annual conference of the Gesellschaft für Musikforschung](https://www.musikundmedien.hu-berlin.de/de/musikwissenschaft/gfm2022) (GfM) in Berlin was an opportunity for the entire Beethoven in the House research team to present progress on all aspects of the project, as well as demonstrate the current stage of application development.

Colleagues at the [Forschungszentrum Beethoven-Archiv](https://www.beethoven.de/en/studies#beethoven-archiv) at Beethoven-Haus Bonn presented preliminary discoveries they have made in the repertoire. Team members from Oxford's [e-Research Centre](https://oerc.ox.ac.uk/) discussed the novel aspect of the project: accessing resources and generating original research entirely within a digital environment--an environment that adheres to the technical specifications of Linked Data.

A demonstration of the __[web application prototype](https://tool.domestic-beethoven.eu/)__ by Paderborn University's [Center for Music, Edition, Media](https://zenmem.de/) (ZenMEM) highlighted the integration of specially developed Optical Music Recognition (OMR) software with an image viewer for remote resources, allowing musicologists to use a mouse to highlight select passages on a facsimile for encoding and comparison.

The series of talks allowed researchers to discuss the technical and musicological aspects of the project with international scholars in musicology and digital humanities.
