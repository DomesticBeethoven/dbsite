The annual conference of the Gesellschaft für Musikforschung (GfM) was this year given the theme _Muskwissenschaft nach Beethoven_ (‘Musicology after Beethoven’). Held in Bonn just after our first in-person full project meeting, it gave us the perfect opportunity to present our goals and our work so far.

Christine Siegert hosted a full-day session on Neue Aufgaben der Beethoven-Forschung (‘New tasks in Beethoven research’), which included papers on the spaces and instrumentation of early performances of Beethoven’s music, on the dedicatees of his music, and the social implications of the use of self-consciously Ländler styles. Kevin and David contributed a paper on the project, entitled [“Beethoven Arrangements: Can digital approaches widen our investigative reach?”](/assets/docs/Page-GfM2021-slides.pdf){:target="_blank"}. We described how our tools and model will support research at different stages of completeness – from speculative exploration to focussed evidence gathering.
