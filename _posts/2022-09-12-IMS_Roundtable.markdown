The 21st Quinquennial Congress of the International Musicological Society was held in August in Athens, where the project hosted a round table chaired by Christine Siegert. The discussion addressed the advantages and difficulties in using digital frameworks and tools to document and analyse the rich repertoire of 19th century arrangements of Beethoven’s works.

All project members and invited colleagues participated, presenting the following topics at the session: _Hidden “Musicking”: Beethoven in the Victorian Home_ ([Christina Bashford](https://music.illinois.edu/people/profiles/christina-bashford/), University of Illinois), _Piano Trio and Vocal Arrangements of the Allegretto in Beethoven’s Seventh Symphony_ (Lisa Rosendahl and Elisabete Shibata); _Domestic Arrangements between General Characteristics and Individual Solutions_ (David Lewis); _Arrangements, Collections, and the Work: A perspective from RISM_ (Andrew Hankinson and [Laurent Pugin](https://www.dh.unibe.ch/ueber_uns/personen/pd_dr_pugin_laurent/index_ger.html), Bern University and RISM Digital Center); _VideAppCorr_ ([Elisa Novara](https://www.beethoven.de/de/person/view/5746055551385600/Elisa-) and [Richard Sänger](https://www.beethoven.de/de/person/view/5674823384563712/Richard-), Beethoven Werkstatt); _Harmonizing Models: Challenges of Sharing Concepts, Data, and Tools between Beethoven Projects_ (Johannes Kepper and Mark Saccomano); and _Music Encoding and Linked Data_ (Kevin Page).

After the round table, there was a lively discussion around both the technological and musicological aspects of the presentations.
