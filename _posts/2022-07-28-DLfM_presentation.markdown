At the conference, David presented a [multi-author paper]() describing our [data model for annotating musical versions](). This included a short demonstration of our model in use as part of a working prototype. At the IAML conference itself, Andrew Hankinson and Kevin Page presented the wider project entitled [‘Beethoven in the House: Annotating Digital Sources to Contextualise Musicology Studies’](/assets/docs/Page-IAML2022-slides.pdf){:target="_blank"}.
