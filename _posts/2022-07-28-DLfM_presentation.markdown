## __DLfM presentation - “A model for annotating musical versions and arrangements across multiple documents and media”__

The international conference on Digital Libraries for Musicology (DLfM) was this year run in association with the annual congress of the International Association of Music Librarians (IAML) in Prague. At the conference, David presented a [multi-author paper]() describing our [data model for annotating musical versions](). This included a short demonstration of our model in use as part of a working prototype. At the IAML conference itself, Andrew Hankinson and Kevin Page presented the wider project entitled [‘Beethoven in the House: Annotating Digital Sources to Contextualise Musicology Studies’](/assets/docs/Page-IAML2022-slides.pdf){:target="_blank"}.
