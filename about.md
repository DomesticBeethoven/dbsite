## **19th Century Practices -- 21st Century Tools**

***Beethoven in the House*** is a three-year digital musicology project that brings together researchers from the University of Paderborn, Beethoven-Haus Bonn, and Oxford University’s e-Research Center. The team will be looking at piano and chamber ensemble arrangements of Beethoven’s symphonic works in order to determine the role these arrangements played in the dissemination of concert music in the 19th century, before the advent of radio and recordings.

For decades, domestic music-making was the principal way for many people to discover and explore concert music. A piece such as Beethoven’s _Große Fuge_, which was performed publicly just once before 1850, could only be experienced by those who bought and performed from the published edition or from arrangements. Domestic performances provided enthusiasts access to music that might not otherwise be heard locally, while also allowing a more leisurely, detailed and participatory exploration of its character and structure.

The choices made by arrangers in adapting works for domestic consumption—of instrumentation, abbreviation, or simplification—reflect the musical life of the 19th-century, and can inform our understanding of this widespread musical  practice. Yet despite the central role they played in reception and dissemination, as well as in canon formation, arrangements of instrumental music have not been well studied.

Comparing multiple arrangements of the same piece will help to identify different approaches and priorities that arrangers may have had and the aesthetic, social, and practical values reflected in their choices. This in turn can enrich our understanding of the audiences and contexts for which particular arrangements were produced.

Importantly, _Beethoven in the House_ will be conducted wholly within a digital working environment—including the design, development, and implementation of novel digital methods—and promises to challenge our ideas about the independence and primacy of the “work” as the ultimate arbiter of musical form.
