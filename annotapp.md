__The Beethoven in the House Annotator App__ is a web-based application that provides support for storing, sharing, and publishing musical commentary along with the exact fragments of the digital resources they reference.

* __*To try the prototype yourself, go to   [https://tool.domestic-beethoven.eu](https://tool.domestic-beethoven.eu){:target="_blank"}*__

 * Read more about the __[design and use of the app](./annotapp)__.


* Make and save your own annotations on remote materials by signing up for a personal Solid pod, a free Linked Data storage system. Available from __[SolidCommunity](https://solidcommunity.net/){:target="_blank"}__.

This tool is a proof of concept for writing editorial annotations as Linked Open Data, combining the Oxford e-Research Centre's [Music Encoding and Linked Data (MELD)](https://meld.web.ox.ac.uk/){:target="_blank"} platform with tools developed by the [Edirom Virtual Research Network (ViFE)](https://www.edirom.de/){:target="_blank"} at Paderborn University.

By displaying arrangements side-by-side, the app facilitates the identification of parallel passages in different versions of the same work. [The data model developed by the project](assets/docs/BitHModelDocumentation_v0.2.1.pdf){:target="_blank"} allows such parallel passages to be linked and annotated as two manifestations of the <i>same musical material</i>.

Once works are selected and loaded into the display pane, a musicologist can point and click on individual notes and measures, or click and drag to select larger regions, whether the resource is a facsimile image or a rendered score encoding.

Prepossessing by Edirom's Cartographer App provides automatic recognition of measure positions to aid in selecting musical content from digitized images.
