__The Beethoven in the House Annotator App__ is a web-based application that provides support for storing, sharing, and publishing musical commentary along with the exact fragments of the digital resources they reference.

* <b>To try out the prototype yourself, go to   <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><i>[https://tool.domestic-beethoven.eu](https://tool.domestic-beethoven.eu){:target="_blank"}</i></span></b>

 <!-- * Read more about the __[design and use of the app](./    )__. -->

This tool is a proof of concept for writing editorial annotations as Linked Data, combining the Oxford e-Research Centre's [Music Encoding and Linked Data (MELD)](https://meld.web.ox.ac.uk/){:target="_blank"} platform with tools developed by the [Edirom Virtual Research Network (ViFE)](https://www.edirom.de/){:target="_blank"} at Paderborn University.

By displaying arrangements side-by-side, the app facilitates the identification of parallel passages in different versions of the same work. [The data model developed by the project](assets/docs/BitHModelDocumentation_v0.2.1.pdf){:target="_blank"} allows such parallel passages to be linked and annotated as two manifestations of the <i>same musical material</i>.

Once works are selected and loaded into the display pane, a musicologist can point and click on individual notes and measures, or click and drag to select larger regions, whether the resource is a facsimile image or a rendered score encoding.

To make and save your own annotations, sign up for a free _Solid_ pod, a decentralized Linked Data storage system. Available from __[SolidCommunity](https://solidcommunity.net/){:target="_blank"}__.


__NB:__ We highly recommend opening the app in a ***private*** or ***incognito*** browser window to avoid conflicts with the Solid protocol.
