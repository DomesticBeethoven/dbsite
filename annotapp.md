The tool's main purpose is to bring together digitised resources in the form of images and digital scores, and allow a musicologist to view them in a browser, selecting specific extracts for study and then annotating those with scholarly commentary. The resulting annotations are stored, and can be shared and published, including references to the pertinent selections from the digital music resources.
Once works are selected and loaded into the display pane, a musicologist can point and click on individual notes and measures, or click and drag to select larger regions, whether the resource is a facsimile image or a rendered score encoding.

Significantly for this project, by allowing the display of more than one work, the app facilitates the identification of parallel passages in different versions. What is of particular significance for this project, the data model developed by the project allows such parallel passages to be linked and annotated as two manifestations of the <i>same musical material</i>. , but Individual selections can be annotated, but also parallel passages in different versions of a work can be identified, and these structures themselves annotated.
