__The Beethoven in the House Annotator App__ is a tool for adding annotations to digital music resources in a Linked Data format that allows them to be saved and shared.

* __*To try the app yourself, go to*   [https://tool.domestic-beethoven.eu](https://tool.domestic-beethoven.eu){:target="_blank"}__

<small>(Note that a personal Solid pod — available from a provider such as __[Inrupt](https://signup.pod.inrupt.com/){:target="_blank"}__ or __[SolidCommunity](https://solidcommunity.net/){:target="_blank"}__ — is required for use.)</small>

These screenshots show how digitized resources can be selected, displayed, and annotated within the app.
