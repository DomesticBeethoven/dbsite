The primary IRI for an OBO Library IRI MUST have the following format: https://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/$namespace.owl

Note: To conform with OBO Foundry Principle 2, the ontology IRI MUST resolve to the ontology file, not a landing page.

Additionally, each ontology SHOULD have an owl:versionInfo statement. When this is stated, it MUST correspond to the version Info.

For a given version of an ontology, the ontology should be accessible at the following URL, where ‘idspace’ is replaced by the IDSPACE in lower case:
OWL: http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/idspace/YYYY-MM-DD/idspace.owl


Maintenance Control Lists

An access control list is a list of registered users, groups, or both, that is associated with one and only one PURL, domain, or partial redirect.
Access control lists ARE ATTRIBUTES of a PURL, domain, or partial redirect.
Maintenance control lists
are created for PURLs, domains, and partial redirects
allow their members to edit the PURL's, domain's, or partial redirect's other access control lists
members are called maintainers of the PURL, domain, or partial redirect
